# repo-assets

This repository contains assets (e.g., images) that I reference in
other repository README files. Since some of these assets can be quite
large and may change from time to time, I often prefer not to bloat
the repositories that display them in READMEs, particularly if the
repository is intended for use by other people. To avoid that bloat, I
put the assets here.
